I utilized bootstrap framework for my responsive design. I initially wanted to have my navbar disappear I decided, but I wanted to keep my nav hamburger bar cuz I felt it represented a modern design since everyone is used to a mobile design. I didnt want to get rid of that aspect.

For JS the 3 points of interaction are all incorporated in the drum sampler. listening for click/keyboard event, playing audio, and changing the mouse icon to a drumstick icon.
